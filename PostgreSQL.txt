PostgreSQL

1) datatype : 

- more data types than MySQL

2) Index : (indexes / indices)

- type: b tree, hash, GIS, fulltext search

- b tree: order by ASC/DESC Null FIRST/LAST

- partial index

- index on Expressions

-  query covering index

must verify that each retrieved row be “visible” to the query's MVCC
snapshot

- create index, include several fields

- combining multiple indices ( AND, OR) 

use bitmap => likely loose the order
this strategy is enabled depend on query planer
Mysql just offers combining several indices for OR Query

- ANALYZE

- EXPLAIN

- EXPLAIN ANALYZE

actually runs the query, any side-effects will happen
as usual => should run in transaction then ROLLBACK 

- EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, COSTS )

- JOIN:

nested loop join (index)
merge join
hash join


3) Client:

- 1 process per connection

MySQL : 1 thread per connection

4) Concurrency control

4) Internal

- Heap-Only Tuples

- Write Ahead Log

- Just in Time Compilation

- Planner/Optimizer

paths: simply cut-down representations of plans containing only as much information as the planner needs to make its decisions
plan: After the cheapest path is determined, a full-fledged plan tree is built to pass to the executor

5) Uber prefer MySQL Over PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL:

- Tuple: 

immutable row data 

ctid: represents the on-disk location (i.e., physical disk offset)

each node in the B-tree holds the ctid value

the primary index and secondary indexes all point directly to the on-disk tuple offsets. When a tuple location changes, all indexes must be updated.

=> write amplification

- replication: Write Ahead Log & 2-phase commit

=> replication amplification

MySQL:

- row: mutable; update row in MVCC is in-place, copy old row to undo log

- index: primary index & secondary index

MySQL uses an extra layer of indirection: secondary index records point to primary index records, and the primary index itself holds the on-disk row locations. 
If a row offset changes, only the primary index needs to be updated.

also makes vacuuming and compaction more efficient

- the MySQL replication binary log is significantly more compact than the PostgreSQL WAL stream,

PostgreSQL internal

- process: 

postmaster

- memory:

shared buffer

- Block and Page

In PostgreSQL, I / O is done on a block basis. The size of the block is 8 KB by default. In order to
In current PostgreSQL, a block contains one page,
therefore a block and a page can be considered the same thing. 131,072 blocks (pages) can be stored
within one file. When the data file exceeds this size (8 KB × 131,072 = 1 GB), a new file is created.
This value is determined by the RELSEG_SIZE macro of pg_config.h file.
In each page, a pointer to each tuple in the page and to the page header is stored. Item pointer
indicates the location of the tuples in the page. Tuple is stored towards the top of the page from the
end of the page. On the other hand, item pointer will be added towards the end of the page immediately
after the page header.

- tuple:

header: t_xmin, t_xmax, t_cid, t_xvac

- Transaction ID wraparound:

In large systems, utilizing a large number of transactions may runs out 32 bits
=> replaces the old transaction ID to a special value (FrozenXID = 2) regularly

- Transaction:

Sequence values are independent of the transaction. Sequence value obtained during a transaction
cannot be rolled back.

- Parallel:

can be executed only for Seq Scan, Join and Aggregate

- Streaming replication:

WAL
cascade

PostgreSQL 14 internal

1) Introduction

1.1 Data organization

- database cluster

- system catalog: metadata of all cluster objects is stored in tables that belong to system catalog

- oid: 4 byte integer

- schemas: are namespaces that store all objects of a database

public
pg_catalog
information_schema
pg_toast
pg_temp

- tablespace: define physical data layout

logical structure & physical data layout do not depend on each other

- relations:

table, index, sequence, materialized view, regular view

- file & fork:

- pages:

(or blocks)
represent the minimum amount of data that can be read or written

- TOAST

The Oversized Attributes Storage Technique

1.2 Processes and Memory

- postmaster

- share memory: buffer cache

1.3 Client & Server 

- 1 process/connection

- dont have built-in connection pooling 
=> use connection pooling in application, or external tools (pgBouncer, etc)


2) Isolation

- consistency

- integrity

- anomaly / phenomena

lost update (prevented in all isolation levels)
dirty read (read uncommitted)
non repeatable read (read committed)
phantom read (repeatable read)
no anomalies (serializable)

- snapshot isolation protocol

Postgres:
read uncommitted: same as read committed
read committed: could occur lost update
repeatable read: no phantom read

3) Pages & Tuples

3.1 Page structure

- page header

- an array of item pointers

- free space

- items (row versions)

- special space

4) Snapshot

5) Page pruning & HOT update

10) Write-ahead log
